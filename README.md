The Closure Table solution is a simple and elegant way of storing hierarchies. It involves storing all paths through a tree, not just those with a direct parent-child relationship. You may want to chose this model, over the [Nested Sets model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model), should you need referential integrity and to assign nodes to multiple trees.

Throughout the various examples and tests, we will refer to the hierarchies depicted below, where we are modeling a hypothetical forum-like discussion between [Rolie, Olie and Polie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTkmaE_QWMQ), and their debate around the usefulness of this implementation :)

Warning:

> This version introduces significant changes. We are removing the concept of a CT Adapter and focusing on using Ecto for the core functions. The (in-memory) adapter has been eliminated.


## Quick start

The current implementation is depending on Ecto >= 3.1; using [Ecto.SubQuery](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.SubQuery.html)!

For this implementation to work you'll have to provide two tables, and the name of the Repo used by your application:

1. a table containing the nodes, with `id` as the primary key. With this new version, you are no longer required to name your primary keys `id`. Although `id` remains the default, you now have the option to use your own keys and data types. Example:

    ```elixir
    # For more details and an example of designing and implementing simple
    # hierarchical structures of tags, see test/custom_node_id_test.exs (excerpt below)
    use CTE,
      repo: Repo,
      nodes: Tag,
      paths: TagTreePath,
      options: %{
        node: %{primary_key: :name, type: :string},
        paths: %{
          ancestor: [type: :string],
          descendant: [type: :string]
        }
      }
    ```

2. a table name for storing the tree paths.
3. the name of the Ecto.Repo, defined by your app

Using a structure like the one above and just a few functions from this library, you will be able to create highly efficient hierarchies such as these. Their management will be quick, accurate, and straightforward:

    food
    ├── vegetable
    ├── fruit
    │  ├── apple
    │  ├── orange
    │  └── berry
    │     └── tomato
    └── meat
      └── burger

In a future version we will provide you with a convenient migration template to help you starting, but for now you must supply these tables.

For example, given you have the following Schemas for comments:

```elixir
      defmodule CT.Comment do
        use Ecto.Schema
        import Ecto.Changeset

        @timestamps_opts [type: :utc_datetime]

        schema "comments" do
          field :text, :string
          belongs_to :author, CT.Author

          timestamps()
        end
      end
```

and a table used for storing the parent-child relationships

```elixir

      defmodule CT.TreePath do
        use Ecto.Schema
        import Ecto.Changeset
        alias CT.Comment

        @primary_key false

        schema "tree_paths" do
          belongs_to :parent_comment, Comment, foreign_key: :ancestor
          belongs_to :comment, Comment, foreign_key: :descendant
          field :depth, :integer, default: 0
        end
      end
```

we can define the following module:

```elixir

      defmodule CT.MyCTE do
        use CTE,
        repo: CT.Repo,
        nodes: CT.Comment,
        paths: CT.TreePath
      end
```

We add our CTE Repo to the app's main supervision tree, like this:

```elixir
      defmodule CT.Application do
        use Application

        def start(_type, _args) do
          children = [
            CT.Repo,
          ]

          opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: CT.Supervisor]
          Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
        end
      end
```

restart your application.

Then using `iex -S mix`, we can start experimenting. Examples:

```elixir
      iex» CT.MyCTE.ancestors(9)
      {:ok, [1, 4, 6]}

      iex» {:ok, tree} = CT.MyCTE.tree(1)
      {:ok,
      %{
      nodes: %{
        6 => %CT.Comment{
          __meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<:loaded, "comments">,
          author: #Ecto.Association.NotLoaded<association :author is not loaded>,
          author_id: 2,
          id: 6,
          inserted_at: ~U[2019-07-21 01:10:35Z],
          text: "Everything is easier, than with the Nested Sets.",
          updated_at: ~U[2019-07-21 01:10:35Z]
        },
        8 => %CT.Comment{
          __meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<:loaded, "comments">,
          author: #Ecto.Association.NotLoaded<association :author is not loaded>,
          author_id: 1,
          id: 8,
          inserted_at: ~U[2019-07-21 01:10:35Z],
          text: "I’m sold! And I’ll use its Elixir implementation! <3",
          updated_at: ~U[2019-07-21 01:10:35Z]
        },
        ...

      },
      paths: [
          [1, 1, 0],
          [1, 2, 1],
          [2, 2, 0],
          [1, 3, 2],
          [2, 3, 1],
          [3, 3, 0],
          [1, 7, 3],
          [2, 7, 2],
     ...
            ]
      }}
```

if you want to visualize a tree, you can do that too:

```elixir
iex» CTE.Utils.print_tree(tree, 1, callback: &({&2[&1], &2[&1].text}))
```

and you may see this:

```txt
Is Closure Table better than the Nested Sets?
├── It depends. Do you need referential integrity?
│  └── Yeah
│     └── Closure Table *has* referential integrity?
└── Querying the data it's easier.
   ├── What about inserting nodes?
   └── Everything is easier, than with the Nested Sets.
      ├── I'm sold! And I'll use its Elixir implementation! <3
      └── w⦿‿⦿t!
```

Please check the docs for more details and return from more updates!

Oh and there is a simple utility for helping you drawing your paths, using graphviz! From Rolie's comments, excerpt:

![dot](assets/dot.dot.dot.png)

Maybe useful?! If yes, then we'll let you find this function by yourself ;)

hint: _check the tests <3_
