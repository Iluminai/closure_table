defmodule CTE do
  @moduledoc """
  The Closure Table for Elixir strategy, CTE for short,
  is a simple and elegant way of storing and working with
  hierarchies. It involves storing all paths through a tree,
  not just those with a direct parent-child relationship. You
  may want to chose this model, over the [Nested Sets model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model),
  should you need referential integrity and to assign nodes to multiple trees.

  With CTE you can navigate through hierarchies using a
  simple [API](CTE.Adapter.html#functions), such as:
  finding the ascendants and descendants of a node, inserting
  and deleting nodes, moving entire sub-trees or print them
  as a digraph (.dot) file.

  Options available to most of the functions:

  - `:limit`, to limit the total number of nodes returned, when finding the ancestors or the descendants for nodes
  - `:itself`, accepting a boolean value. When `true`, the node used for finding its neighbors are returned as part of the results. Default: true
  - `:nodes`, accepting a boolean value. When `true`, the results are containing additional information about the nodes. Default: false


  ### Quick example.

  In this example the: `:nodes` attribute, will be a Schema i.e. `Post`, `TreePath`, etc!
  In our initial implementation, the nodes definitions must have at least the
  `:id`, as one of their properties. This caveat will be lifted
  in a later implementation.
